# Getting Started
There are several ways to get Spry running, and there are several ways to use and run Spry.

## REPL
Absolutely most trivial way is to use the [REPL](repl) web page here in this site. That's an actual Spry interpreter compiled to javascript. But this is just a toy.

## Windows
Windows is a ... messy platform. On Linux or OSX it's very easy to build Spry yourself (see below) but on Windows it's a bit more complicated. I have put together a trivial zip file with binaries if you just want to try it out:

* [http://files.krampe.se/spry/spry-0.8.0-win32.zip](http://files.krampe.se/spry/spry-0.8.0-win32.zip)

Just download and unzip somewhere and double click on **ispry.exe** to get into the REPL VM. Or pull up a command prompt, cd into this directory and run **spry.exe** together with a script, for example like this:

    spry hello.sy

The included files with the sy-extension are just plain text files you can edit and run this way.

## Linux and OSX
Se below! :)

## Building yourself
If you want to start fiddling more seriously with Spry you would want to clone it from github and build it yourself. It's quite easy, just follow the [instructions on github](https://github.com/gokr/spry#installation).
