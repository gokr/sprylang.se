# About Spry
I have always entertained thoughts of making my own programming language. Ever since 1994 I have been an avid [Smalltalker](http://www.world.st) and I was for many years very active in the [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) community. The Smalltalk coding experience and environment is in many ways still completely unmatched.

But Alan Kay is right that Smalltalk and Lisp *"tend to eat their young"* which may be a slightly obscure phrase, but I think both these two camps are so comfortable in their respective environments that they have stopped even thinking that things can be **improved**, that we can still **innovate**. I think it's about time to move forward!

And now that I have found a [really fast implementation language](http://nim-lang.org) that I actually enjoy working in, I [started burning](http://goran.krampe.se/2015/09/16/ni-a-strange-little-language/) in late 2015.

The language is called Spry but was initially named Ni (as in the Knights Who Sayâ€¦), but I decided to rename it. Spry has a good ring to it, it seems fairly nice to google and I managed to catch sprylang.org, but for various reasons ended up with the Swedish TLD instead, [sprylang.se](http://www.sprylang.se).

And `#sprylang` is a good hash for twitter. :)
