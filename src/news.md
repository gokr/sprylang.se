## Benchmarking Spry vs Squeak 5.1
_2016-08-26_

I posted an article on my blog [about some small benchmark snippets](http://goran.krampe.se/2016/08/26/benchmarking-spry-vs-squeak/) that I tried in both Squeak 5.1 and current Spry. Back in may I also wrote [another article](http://goran.krampe.se/2016/05/24/spry-performance/) looking at other performance aspects.

I have also started [an article on this site comparing Spry and Smalltalk](spry-vs-smalltalk).
